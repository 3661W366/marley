=Marley 

Sorry for the lack of documentation.  For now, please just read through the source code if you're interested.

The basics:  Marley makes lots of assumptions, all of which should be override-able.

* Marley looks for resources (as indicated by the first part of the URL) in the Marley::Resources namespace as constants
  * A resource must respond either to a "controller" method or to one or more REST verbs. 
  * Resources implementing a "controller" method should return an object that responds to one or more REST verbs from that method
  * REST verb methods should return a string to be sent to the client

* Marley provides 2 plugins for the Sequel ORM.
  * RestConvenience - Adds a default controller for standard rest routes to a model
  * RestAuthorization - Adds default authorization to a model

* "Joints" are pre-packaged resource sets that can be included in a Marley application.  Unfortunately, for now, their behavior can only be chaged by monkey patching. 

* The default Marley client is "Jamaica", which consists of JS/CSS for browsers.  It sucks right now and I'm hoping somebody takes it over as a sub-project, but it does work - at least on FF.

* The server and client use a JSON based data representation I developed for this project and tentatively named "Reggae."  I need to nail it down and document it, but basically it's a recursive list of lists, each of which has the format ["name",{properties},[contents]].

More when I can spare the time.
