- complete switchover to tdoc
- separate plugins from joints
  -keep current plugin structure or ditch it for separate plugins?
    - 3rd option - implement both, deprecate 1 before stable release
  - change module structure to accommodate plugins
    - possibilities:
      - separate module for plugins
      - shared module for plugins/joints
      - module which contains Joints and Plugins module
    - thoughts:
      - This is very much a semantic question.  As such, it may be strongly advisable to ditch the 'Joints' monicker in favor of something dramatically more boring 
  - CURRENTLY ATTEMPTING:  hierarchical namespaces as follows:
    Marley::Resources
    Marley::Plugins 
      _PluginName_
        Extend
        Include
    Marley::Joints
      _JointName_
        Resources
        Plugins 
          _PluginName_
            Extend
            Include

      plugins seem to embody a pattern of connecting resources.  perhaps this should be implemented by a joint_connector???


      SHOULD Marley BE A CLASS AND JOINTS A SUBCLASS???  THE OTHER WAY ROUND??  Should both inherit from another class or include a different module???
      
    In this scenario, subclasses of 'Joint' would look more or less the same as now, but with read/wite access to a generic plugins namespace and some kind of dynamic method of applying them based on ???what???
   The MJ::MyJoint::FooPlugin idiom would change to integrating an Marley::Plugins module 


NEXT STEP: combine Tag.tagging for and TaggedMessaging::MessagePlugin.  If that works, this is most likely the way to go.  Will still need to think it through, though.
      
ANOTHER THOUGHT:  app.rb essentially becomes a configuration file.  all the "active" code sits in joints/ and plugins/.  Might want to revisit autoload thing.

REGARDLESS:  MUST BRANCH next time I do anything major.
    
  
- rename client to sth like output
  - move all output there
- fix JS
- ditch Sequel dependency
  - ORM as a Joint??
  - automate sequel plugin loading in options

-----------------

- better filtering options for posts
- better logging
- implement instance_list
- expose validation reflections to views
??? caching protocol for autocompleters/validation options
